Amongst Calvin Students we believe there is a general lack of awareness of the numerous campus wide events and gatherings outside sports. As a group we are looking to use this opportunity to build "app name" as an iOS/android mobile application that will provide its users the ability to view, schedule and set reminders for events and gatherings they may be interested in attending. In addition, users will be able to see and connect with others attending the same events. Unlike the already existing web pages scattered all over Calvins website, "app name" will provide students with a convenient and easy to use interface with all the appropriate info in a centralized manner as well as bring awareness to the various clubs and small group meetings and gatherings Calvin has to offer.
