## VisionStatement
Calvin Students are often unaware of the numerous campus wide events and gatherings outside sports. Knight connect is an iOS/android mobile application that will provide its users the ability to view, schedule and set reminders for events and gatherings they may be interested in attending. From a list of categories, Knight connect users will be able to select their preferences which will then be used to suggest appropriate events. In addition, users will be able to see and connect with others attending the same events.

Unlike the already existing web pages scattered all over Calvins website, Knight connect will provide students with a convenient and easy to use interface with all the appropriate information in a centralized manner as well as bring awareness to the various clubs, small group meetings and gatherings Calvin has to offer.
