# KnightConnect

## VisionStatement
Calvin Students are often unaware of the numerous campus wide events and gatherings outside sports and therefore need a platform that will serve as an easily accessible source of information. Knight connect is a mobile application that will provide its users with this information and the ability to view, schedule and set reminders for events and gatherings they may be interested in attending. From a list of categories, Knight connect users will be able to select their preferences which will then be used to suggest appropriate events.

Unlike the already existing web pages and event calendar scattered across Calvin's website, KnightConnect users will be able to see and connect with others attending the same events. We believe this social aspect of KnightConnect is what gives it an edge over the competition. In addition KnightConnect will provide students with a convenient and easy to use interface with all the appropriate information in a centralized manner as well as bring awareness to the various clubs, small group meetings and gatherings Calvin has to offer.
