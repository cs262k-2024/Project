"In harmony we rise, no task too great,  
With every voice, we shape our fate.  
Together we build, together we strive,  
Teamwork makes the dream work, keeps hope alive.  

Through ups and downs, hand in hand we’ll go,  
In unity’s embrace, our dreams will glow.  
With shared vision bright, we’ll reach for the stars,  
Together we’ll journey, no dream too far." - gpt4
